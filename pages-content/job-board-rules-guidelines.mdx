### Job Submission and Approval Process:

- We welcome job submissions from all industries and technologies, as long as they are beneficial to the community.
- After successful job submission, each job will undergo a basic verification process by the PyConf India 2025 team to filter out potential spam. However, this process may not be highly rigorous.
- The approval process may take approximately 3-4 days.
- Approved jobs will be made visible on the job board once they pass the verification process.
- Submissions that do not meet the guidelines may be rejected, and submitters will be notified of the reasons for rejection.
- If the position you posted has been filled, and you are no longer taking applications, please contact our team at [contact@hydpy.org](mailto:contact@hydpy.org), so we can take down your posting.
- The job board will remain accessible to the community until 9th March 2025, which is two weeks after the conclusion of the conference. After that, all job postings will be taken down.

### Job Posts Order:

- Job posts are sorted based on the timestamp they are submitted. The first job submitted will be visible first, followed by subsequent submissions in chronological order.

### Transparency:

- The PyConf Hyderabad 2025 job board is provided solely as a platform for job listings and does not have any direct connection to the hiring or recruitment process.
- Job seekers and companies are encouraged to communicate directly with each other for job-related inquiries, applications, and hiring decisions.

### Content Moderation:

- PyConf Hyderabad 2025 reserves the right to moderate and remove job posts that violate submission guidelines or community standards.
- Users are encouraged to report any inappropriate content or issues with job posts for review to our team at [contact@hydpy.org](mailto:contact@hydpy.org).

### Respect and Inclusivity:

- Users are expected to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment when interacting with job listings or other users on the platform.
- Any kind of disrespectful, discriminatory, or offensive behavior against any party will not be tolerated.
- Please make sure to follow PyConf Hyderabad's [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).
- If you feel unsafe during any of the interactions, or feel like someone is violating the rules, please [report the incident to the CoC Workgroup](/reporting-guide/).

Disclaimer: PyConf Hyderabad 2025 is not responsible for the accuracy, quality, or legitimacy of job listings, and users should exercise their discretion when applying for jobs.
