Tired of skyrocketing software costs across multiple apps, features, and modules? Gridlex eliminates per-app pricing, enabling businesses to build everything they need on one powerful, customizable platform. Instead of paying separately for CRM, Service, ITSM, and other tools, companies can consolidate their software stack—fully tailored to their needs—at a single cost, reducing software expenses by 50-90%.

With Gridlex App Builder, you’re not just cutting costs—you can also build, white-label, and sell your own SaaS application without writing code. The platform offers database-like models, relationship mapping, form builders, page layouts, automation, and role-based access controls, all within an intuitive web-based interface. Every app is fully white-labeled and hosted on your own domain (e.g., app.YourDomain.com), ensuring complete control over branding and deployment. IT service firms, solution partners, and agencies can also leverage Gridlex to create custom apps that strengthen customer relationships and drive new revenue streams.

We are immensely grateful to Gridlex for their generous support.
