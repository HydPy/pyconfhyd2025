## Getting Started

### Install Node.js and Package Manager

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js and a package manager installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Node.js**:

   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the v20.18.0 version. This was the latest LTS version when the project was created.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. **Verify Installation**:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to check if Node.js is installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - You should see the version number of Node.js.

3. **Install a Package Manager**:
   - Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) by default. To check if npm is installed, run:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use other package managers like Yarn or pnpm.

### Run the Development Server

Once Node.js and a package manager are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
